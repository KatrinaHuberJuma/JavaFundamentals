// Mandatory Method: Java program processing starts from the main() 
// 	method which is a mandatory part of every executable Java program. 
// 	It should look like this:
// 			public static void main(String[] args){
// 			    // your code
// 			}


// void is the return type when the method doesn't have a return
// system is a class, .out creates an instance of a PrintStream class, that has a .println method for printing to the terminal

// Method Names: All method names should start with a lower case letter. 
	// If there are multiple words in the method, 
	// they should be written in lowerCamelCase. 
	// Typically, we use verbs as method names, 
	// rather than noun statements.
